  ``sphinxcontrib-jsdemo`` -- HTML/Javascript Demo extension for Sphinx
*************************************************************************

Overview
========

``sphinxcontrib-jsdemo`` is an extension for embedding HTML/Javascript
demo snippets into Sphinx_ documents.

You can see this extension in action at
http://htsql.org/htraf/index.html

This software is written by Kirill Simonov (`Prometheus Research, LLC`_)
and released under BSD license.


Usage
=====

To enable this extension, add the following line to ``conf.py``::

    extensions.append('sphinxcontrib.jsdemo')

Now you can include a snippet of HTML/Javascript code to a Sphinx
document using ``demo`` directive.  For example::

    .. demo::

       <button>Click me!</button>

The directive renders it content twice: as a raw HTML block (demo) and
as a literal block (source).

Option ``layout`` allows you to control the relative order of the blocks.
For example, the following directive renders the source block first,
then the demo block, which content is initially hidden::

    .. demo::
       :layout: +source, -demo

       <button>Click me, too!</button>


Reference
=========

Directives
----------

``demo``
    Inserts demo and source blocks.

    The directive is rendered as a composite node with two blocks:

    * A *demo* block containing raw HTML content.

    * A *source* block with the same content in literal form.

    Clicking on a block header toggles the block's visibility.

    Options:

    ``layout``
        This option controls the order of the blocks and their
        initial visibility.  It must contain comma-separated
        list of blocks with optional ``+`` or ``-`` indicators
        specifying the initial visibility.  Examples:

        ``demo, source``
            Render the *demo* block before the *source* block.

        ``+source, -demo``
            Render the *source* block before the *demo* block.
            The *demo* block must be hidden initially.

        ``-demo``
            Render the *demo* block only, hidden initially.
